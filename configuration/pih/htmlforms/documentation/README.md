# PIH OpenMRS HTML Form documentation

The contents of this /documentation folder are .csv files to accompany the form configuration files in the parent directory.  

These were generated by AI using the prompt:

```
Please describe the questions and answers on this OpenMRS form in a .csv using the following columns:

Question
Datatype
Possible Answers
input type
required?
skip logic?
concept for question
concepts for answers
group name (if part of concept group)
concept group mapping

The possible answers column should contain the answer names (not mappings), and the concept columns should use the format "PIH:14706".  Since it is a .csv, do not use commas within a column.
The output should be a CSV code block.

Please use the same file name as the form name (e.g. section-heart-failure.csv)

Here is the form: [insert path or URL to your OpenMRS HTML form file]
```

This is a work-in-progress.  Files will be added here over time.  Eventually it will good to develop some sort of automated process to generate these as the forms are created and modified.
